# QR Music Player

Lets you play music (a playlist, using [musicpd](https://www.musicpd.org/)) by showing the camera a QR code with the playlist name.

Includes a tool to generate printable cards with album art and QR code. Also includes (because I decided this would be easier) a tool to generate a set of 12 random (or not random) QR codes on an Avery 22816 sheet, which are the right size to stick onto a credit-card sized token.

# Installation

Use [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics/).
